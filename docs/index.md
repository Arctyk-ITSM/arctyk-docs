# Overview

## About Arctyk ITSM

**Arctyk ITSM** is a modular, enterprise-grade IT Service Management platform designed to streamline IT operations for organizations of all sizes.  
Built with Django and modern open-source technologies, it combines flexibility, scalability, and maintainability into a single unified solution.

Arctyk ITSM emphasizes modular architecture, allowing you to enable or disable specific applications—such as ticketing, asset management, or reporting—without affecting the core system.  
This approach makes it ideal for teams that want to start small and expand functionality over time.

## Release Plan Roadmap


**Arctyk Core** (**Arctyk ITSM Core**)

The following release plan covers Arctyk Core which is the base for Arctyk ITSM. Arctyk Core features the ticketing system and basic user management. 

The idea of Arctyk Core, or Arctyk ITSM Core, is to provide a solid base to build a fully modular ITSM system. Another potential idea is to provide a version of Arctyk Core for free (or very low cost) which would be called Arctyk Community.
